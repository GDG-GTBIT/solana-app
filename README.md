# TIGER-DEV

The Malayan Tiger Conservation project employs Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for data storage. Its NFT marketplace features digital collectibles of endangered Malayan tigers, raising awareness and funds.

This tech-environmental fusion blends an intuitive interface with advocacy, creating a digital ecosystem for meaningful user engagement. The project effectively promotes awareness and financial support for Malayan tiger conservation through innovative use of technology.

This project addresses Malayan tiger endangerment by seamlessly integrating Flutter and Firebase for an NFT marketplace. With just 150 tigers left, it amplifies awareness and funds for preservation. Users actively trade NFTs, contributing to the cause. The innovative blend of tech and environmental advocacy creates a dynamic ecosystem supporting Malayan tiger protection. It bridges the gap between technology and conservation, fostering a meaningful connection for users to play a vital role in ensuring the survival of these endangered species.

With only 150 Malayan tigers left, our solution employs Flutter connected to Firebase, creating an NFT marketplace for their digital collectibles. User engagement through NFT transactions generates crucial awareness and funds for tiger preservation.
